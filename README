What's JNChem about?
--------------------

Java library to interact with the Nature Chemistry website, with the primary goal to extract data from papers, to 
fulfill to ultimate goal of being able to say:

"Hey, that is an interesting paper! I wonder if their findings match my work last year, or if the measurements 
contradict what I found! Let's have my computer compare the data!"

(and of goes JNChem to download the data behind the paper and starts some analyses)

What about Project Prospect?
----------------------------

Yeah, good idea! Should have thought about that myself! Nature Chemistry first; patches welcome.
